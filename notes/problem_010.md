# ðŸ§® Summation of primes

This program finds sum of primes less than or equal to a given number N.

# Key insights 

- This program uses the sieve logic in problem 7.
- Then it extracts the primes and sums them using a function.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

```bash
g++ problem_10.cpp -o Summation_of_primes
./Summation_of_primes
