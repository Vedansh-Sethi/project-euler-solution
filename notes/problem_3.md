# ðŸ§® Largest Prime Factor Finder

This C++ program efficiently computes the largest prime factor of given integers using an optimized trial division algorithm.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Insight

> Why not check every number up to `n`? Because math. Here's the breakdown:

- **Even factors (2)** are removed first to simplify things.
- After that, only **odd numbers** are checked up to `âˆšn`, since any composite factor `> âˆšn` must already have had a smaller factor.
- If anything's left after this process, itâ€™s the **largest prime factor**.

### ðŸ§  Example: 3465

Steps:
1. Divide out 3 â†’ 385
2. Divide out 5 â†’ 77
3. Divide out 7 â†’ 11
4. 11 is prime, and no smaller factors left. Answer: `11`.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

```bash
g++ prime_factor.cpp -o prime_factor
./prime_factor
